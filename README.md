# Material Girl Node

## Prerequisites

You'll need node version 16 to run this app. NVM is the best way to do this on mac and linux operating systems in case we later update the node version or if you just have a bunch of apps with different node requirements.

You'll also want mongo 4.4 community edition. Follow the below instructions to install it!

- Node Version Manager: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Mongo 4.4 Community: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

## Getting started

Once you've installed the prerequisites, you can start the app like a normal node app and get developing!

1. Install and use node.js version 16
```
    nvm install 16
    nvm use 16
```
2. Start the node app! (This runs the "start" script defined in `package.json`)
```
    npm start
```
3. You should see something like "`Server running on http://localhost:3000`"
